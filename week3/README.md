For this week, I really wanted to explore story telling using song as a medium. My intentions were to have it a bit theatrical, not serious music, and reflect the feeling of the time.  

The song is a 'chase your story' song, that follows a simple story line of a girl and her path with understanding her sexuality. This was more an experiment for me to better understand song as medium, as well as how to apply my songwriting skills to situations I have not experienced myself. 

The song begins with an intro for all. It starts with an upbeat, quirky beat, setting the scene. I explored theatrical methods of speaking // singing. 

PLEASE NOTE**** I am sick this week, and you can hear my blocked nose while I am speaking. So please do not judge my singing abilities, because I am sensitive at this moment in time :) I tried my best with what my voice could do for me. 

**INTRO: **

Lyrics:

_Well, I guess its cuffing season or something, I dont know_

_All my friends are getting into relationships, but I dont- I dont know if I want to,_

_Its just, _

_Maybe its not for me_

_Well actually until my friend came up to me at schook yesterday and she was all excited and jumping and giddy and she was like:_

_"I heard from a friend of a friend,_

_He's super cute and a 10/10_

_He asked me for you number made it hard to tell him no_

_And I know you dont want to but I think that you should go"_

_Not sure if I need the validation_

_But dont seem to get the tingly sensation_

_So now the choice is to go on the date or to not._

**if you Choose to date:**

Lyrics:

_He calls me pretty, _

_He listens and cares,_ 

_I feel shitty_

_That I cant be there like he's here for me, _

_And I dont know where to begin._ 

_The way he looks at me,_

_Like Im the only thing that he can see_

_His love and devotion; its me I hate._

_Both our hearts are in my hands to break. Oh they'll break._

**If you choose not to date:**

Lyrics: 
_I've been alone, _

_For what feels like too long_

_I know, I know _

_Its me whos at fault_ 

_And I watch all the people, who have what I want._

_Wondering, what it is about me thats wrong_

_Do I have what it takes to love and let go?_

_Or is it not for me, I really want to know._ 

**New Era **

Lyrics: 
_Well, ive been alone for a while,

_But I actually think things have been getting better_

_I think I realised I cant force myself to do that,_

_and I cant force someone else to stay. _

_I've actually been really excited because_

_Semester's just begun,_

_Its a new Era looking for some fun_

_none of these boys seem to intrigue, _

_but thats okay I'll work on me _

_And I made a brand new friend_, 

_She smart and our conversations never end_

_Its never been so easy_

_We complement each other, we have chemistry_

_She's my sunlight_
, 
_Our friendship is one of a kind,_

_I hope I dont mess this up, my track record hasnt been so great
oh wait,_

fuck,

_she just asked me out for dinner_

_does she mean like, 'dinner' dinner'? or like friendship dinner_

_uh- I dont know what to say_

_should I?_

_I dont know what to say_

**Choice 2 No**

lyrics: 

_I ruin everything good 

_My heart is sitting where my feet usually stood, _

_We had something good_

_My head is running through all the coulds and the shoulds_

_And now i watch her_

_With her hands in the hair of someone I do not care for_

_now Im angry_

_That now she's with her when it should have been me_

_What is this type of feeling?_

_My thoughts are so loud I can felt them_

_Does my jealousy show, _

_why does this hurt too much I want to know?_

**Choice 2 Yes**

Lyrics: 
_We went to see a movie then we took a walk outside, _

_Ran through a few sprinkles_

_God i love the way she smiles_

_Not to sound cheesy, but my heart is on the floor._

_And like, I've never felt like this before_

_I dont want it to end_

_I find myself wishing,_

_That I can see her again. _

_Is this what I was missing?_
