<h1> Identity Complexity </h1>

_The main idea is to have a song. A song that sounds normal. It has melodies. It has beats and fun elements. But its actually composed of different feelings and energies. The idea is to have an immersive room, where each corner expresses a different emotion of the complexity of a mind. The whole song comes across as bubbly, fun, happy, quirky. But each corner and element, as you approach it, you will hear actual sadness, fear, insecurity, and other elements, that make you understand better the facade of the brain._


**Main:**

Hi! This is who I am! I am opinionated! I am bubbly, social, quirky. I like to say how I feel, I like to express myself and my opinions. I always speak in class. I always make jokes. I like to share my personality with people, and I am not ashamed of showing my character. I am social, I want to get to know people, and want people to get to know me! I like to read, and I like to make music! I want to experience and learn about the world. I am a humanist, an intersectional feminist, and am passionate about so many social justice issues! I’m very independent, and I enjoy my solitude. If I could travel the world alone I would! The world has endless possibilities!

**Insecurity:**

Are my opinions stupid? Am I annoying? Should I speak up? Should I shut up? Nobody wants to hear your opinions. Your jokes are not funny. Your personality is annoying. Do people enjoy spending time with you because of your personality, or because they like the way you listen to them and make them feel? Just because you read doesn’t mean you are smart. Just because you sing doesn’t mean you are good. Your care about the world is performative.   Do people even enjoy spending time with you? You’re a very average person. 

**Fear:**

You are taking up too much space. Ladies do not raise their voices. Polite girls do not draw attention to themselves. Quiet your down. Giggle, do not cackle. Don’t overshare your personality. If you are nice to people, they will take advantage of you. Women always get taken advantage of. You could end up just like everyone else you know, trapped in an unhappy misogynistic marriage. The system is not built for people like you. If you are always alone, you will compromise your safety. If you are independent, you will be alone forever. 

**Sadness:**

I am tired. Pretending is so hard. I want to go home. I want to be alone. I am tired of people. I am tired of talking, and speaking, and pretending everything is okay. I don’t want to get to know anyone, and I know I am not worth being known. I use books and music for escapism because I no longer want to be here. The world is a dark place. Everything is fucked. There is no good left in this world so what is the point of trying?  

**Anxiety:**

Are people listening? Have you talked for too long? Maybe this person is only pretending to listen to you out of respect. Did you interrupt them? Look them in the eye, otherwise thats rude. Make sure they feel involved and heard. Don’t nod your head too much or it will look like you are fake listening. What is the world going to look like in a few years? People are being killed daily, the earth is dying, technology is rotting our lives. What are we going to do? How are we going to come out of this? How is this salvageable?
