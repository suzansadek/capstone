<h1> A kilometer in my shoes. </h1>

Last week I had an ITP Class titled ‘Interactive story-telling for Liberation,’ where we spent the first class discussing what makes us feel liberated, and how we would incorporate that into our work. The idea of creating something for liberation really resonated with me, and I began to consider whether I can apply it to my capstone project. I initially began with considering what it is that makes me liberated, and making a list. My liberations are small and big, they are contextual and all encapsulating, they are subtle and direct. There is an endless list of liberations I can think of. So How do I create something that makes me feel liberated? Should my focus be to create something that liberates others? Will creating something that liberates me, find a way to reach others?

As I explored my freedoms and restrictions, I began to also consider what I am passionate and focused on. As a person with many different intersecting identities, I realized that not only are my interests contextual but ever-changing and growing. The idea I decided to explore this week is a piece called A kilometer in my shoes. The idea explores a day or a segment in my life, where my intersectionalities pop up in questions that the audiences have to choose. The questions subtly hint at the underlying issues that someone like me face on a daily basis. This could be interpreted in many different ways, and some messages may not be understood, but that’s okay. Just experiencing a day in someone else’s shoes may be a notable change. For example, if I were to host this on a VR or a walkthrough- style website, having the character’s viewpoint be from my height may be a notable change to other people who have a different perspective of the same streets.
